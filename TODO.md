NEXT: Create house show

IDEAS AND STUFF
* Make a game out of hiring / firing
 - Monthly income derived from house shows
 - [Interruption] Talent injuries
 - Companies lure talent away (and vice versa)
 - Pay talent spot bonuses to increase satisfaction
 - Traits to prefer some wrestlers to others
 - Wrestler compatibility in programs
 - Wrestler Satisfaction:
   - Avg. Position on card
   - Time away from home
   - Injury recuperation
   - Salary
   - Gimmick reception from fans
 - Position on card doesn't equal high drawing. Up to player to balance
 - Wrestler draw => Position on card * gimmick popularity * Work rate * charisma
 - Work rate => Fitness * Wrestler Satisfation
 - Match quality => Work rate * (multiplier based on number of times talent has worked together)
 - Staff are advisors a la Civilization but who can be replaced to give better advice
   - Each has own demands, suggestions, and desired working conditions
 - Companies can buy each other to get bigger, access to more territories and talent, etc.
 - Talent leaves much faster when company can't pay salary

House shows:
 - Player determines which locations and programs
 - Advisor suggests routing, venues
 - Has to balance number of locations vs. wrestler time off
 - Time away from home plays a role in satisfaction
 - Injury recovery requires time off the road (or painkillers?)
 - Eventually (in-game), player needs to make it back for TV tapings

Company rankings:
 - Best performance
